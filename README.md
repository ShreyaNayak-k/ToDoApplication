ToDo Application

Developed a simple and functional To-Do application using Java, Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, and MySQL. The application allows users to add tasks, toggle task completion status, and delete tasks. Leveraged Spring MVC for handling requests and Thymeleaf for rendering dynamic views. Integrated CRUD operations with a MySQL database and implemented user-friendly UI features to manage tasks efficiently.
